    "5. This is an important problem because many things can be done knowing how multiple factors determine the quality of a country's democratic quality. It demonstrates how much people trust their government, and the fairness of the government in terms of people's quality of life through social support and freedom of choices. This can also be seen in terms of corruption and income inequality which all attribute to the democratic quality. If resources and practices are allocated from developed countries to developing and underdeveloped countries, these countries could improve in numerous areas which would cause an increase in happiness as well. Finding out how correlated all these features are to the democratic quality would further which areas could be improved on first. I also believe these factors are strongly or at least moderately correlated with this label."

I could also use Decision Trees or Stochastic Gradient Descent if I find that a logistic regression model doesn't output very linear relationships, meaning a more complex relationship would have to be analyzed. To improve the model, I will see which features have correlation with the label and drop the features that aren't as correlated with it. I will build a logistic regression model that tests 25% of the data and trains with 75% of it. I will print values of the weights for each feature as well as the overall RMSE and R^2 scores and possibly test with more or less features based off of this. I will also graph the linear regression line as well."
